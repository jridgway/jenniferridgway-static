					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] I&#8217;ve enjoyed this video from fellow Maryland Teaching Artist Khaleshia Thorpe-Price, owner of&#160;Dramatic Play, and her son.

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] When a partner cannot meet your pay rates, ask about other benefits that they could offer you. Do they have a studio or rehearsal hall that you could access for free? Could they make their medical or retirement plans available to you (you will have to pay out-of-pocket, but you will have member access)? Want a lunch date and one-on-one time with their artistic director? Do they have access to a library or other resources? Think creatively about benefits. What does your business need that they have and could make available to you? Our business partnerships must share the same values as our business, and one of those values should include your value and worth! Remember that pie I mentioned Sunday. [&#8230;]]]></description>
