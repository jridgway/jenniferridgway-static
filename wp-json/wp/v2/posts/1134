Organizations, funders, other TAs, and even yourself will work against you and your network. For some reason, they and we (and me) don&#8217;t think Teaching Artists deserve the fees listed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently a TAMA TA Cafe attendee stated the figures were unrealistic. Admittedly, I agreed with the comment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fees are unreasonably high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By traditional standards.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, we have accepted wages that undervalue our contributions. We must work collectively to change this cultural norm in our field. Perhaps you can live sustainably at the rates we are currently receiving. Most cannot. A few of you are paid well. Most are not. Pay inequity has been a barrier to building TA networks and organizing. Talking about contracts is a no-no and discussing our pay is a faux-pas. Without networking, we cannot grow loyalty, trust, and commitment to each other. We cannot build credibility and morale as collaborators and paid professionals without coalitions. Without organizing, we don&#8217;t stand with each other and demand higher wages for all. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a paradox in our field, as much of our collective work aims to further social justice and equity. Yet, we must resolve the social inequities in our own house first &#8211; <em>the home of the field<\/em>. Without doing so, we are complicit in social evils. A sad, hard truth to face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a doctor or lawyer. Would they ever suggest their fees were too high? I doubt it. Even the Maryland <strong>Volunteer<\/strong> Lawyers for the Arts had expectations and costs for their session last week with the Teaching Artists of the Mid-Atlantic. They understand their value. They recognize their worth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My dear colleagues, what the heck is wrong with us? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our collectives are growing places that will advance our profession. I should refer to these tips as steps. I should also note this isn&#8217;t always a linear, forward marching process. More on that later this week. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, start with <a href=\"https:\/\/jenniferridgway.com\/2022\/04\/04\/tas-thriving-tip-1-join-an-accountability-network\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1118\">step one<\/a>. Build loyalty, trust, and commitment to each other. Collaborate on art. Discuss the business of teaching artistry and what is needed in your local community. At some point, move to <a href=\"https:\/\/jenniferridgway.com\/2022\/04\/04\/tas-thriving-tip-2-ask-questions-of-your-partners-and-clients\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1138\">step two<\/a>. Meet with local organizations, councils and other entities who hire, train, and support teaching artists and <strong>ask questions<\/strong>. Build your credibility and morale as a team working towards professionalism that promotes social justice and equity. The collective&#8217;s gut will almost seamlessly move you into using the TA Pay Calculator. It&#8217;s like a growing garden. Sometimes you have to wait for the fruits of your labors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must do the prep and the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But don&#8217;t give up hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While our self-esteem may wax and wane as we move along in our professional journey, our financial health should continually grow. All should thrive in this field; <strong>we must advocate collectively for our field and profession to expect living wages. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the calculator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>You either walk inside your story and own it, or you stand outside your story and hustle for your worthiness.<\/p><cite>Bren\u00e9 Brown<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links is-style-logos-only is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-social-links-layout-1 wp-block-social-links-is-layout-flex\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This tip would be on a Jeopardy Championship Game for Teaching Artists!
