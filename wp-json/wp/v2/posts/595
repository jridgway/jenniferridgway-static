I must actively seek out and instigate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the year, I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nyzgeOMniVs\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nyzgeOMniVs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">asked<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nyzgeOMniVs\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nyzgeOMniVs\"> you<\/a> to put yourself on the <a href=\"https:\/\/teachingartistsguild.org\/asset-map\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/teachingartistsguild.org\/asset-map\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Teaching Artists Guild&#8217;s Asset Map<\/a>.

The Guild gave Miko and I an opportunity to present a checklist that offered suggestions to arts organizations to improve their connection with teaching artists.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes!  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A step in the right direction.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But only a step. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hidden in the article was a sentence that moves me to sing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em>TAs need these private spaces to build unity and cohesion in a growing worldwide field, reaching across all artistic mediums and its many and varied sectors. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sentence I think is overlooked and I want to share what inspired it for me.  Since the top of the pandemic, TAMA has regularly hosted Monday morning zoom meetings.  The TA Cafe is a place for teaching artists to support each other and work through the challenges we faced individually and collectively.   <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of those initial weeks, I began developing a pitch or story about the importance of teaching artist networks.  That summer, the talented entrepreneur <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ceoincarts\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ceoincarts\">Kayla Harley<\/a> hosted me for a FB live session to raise awareness about TAMA&#8217;s meetings.  I pulled out props so that I could visually tell the story.  I told my TA colleagues who have become friends during this year that I was going to record it and share it on social media.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">For a year, I procrastinated on recording this video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The time was never right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video always needed revisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, guess what, perfection isn&#8217;t real.  Besides this blog is supposed to be about process.  I sincerely want to process all that has happened, is happening and can happen with you, colleagues.   <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here it is&#8230;. Consider my invitation to &#8220;Find Your TA Home.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LkdMgtgzdQU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">I do believe there is value in networks that are by, for and about Teaching Artists.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what about you, dearest colleague?  I want to hear from you.   <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have a teaching artist home? Why or why not?  If you do, where?  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can we take a moment to shine a spotlight on all the teaching artist collectives across the nation?
